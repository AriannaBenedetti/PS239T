The review of C\\x99te d\\xd5Ivoire was held at the 4th meeting, on 29 April 2014. The delegation of C\\x99te d\\xd5Ivoire was headed by Mr. Gn\\x8en\\x8ema Mamadou Coulibaly. At its 10th meeting, held on 2 May 2014, the Working Group adopted the report on C\\x99te d\\xd5Ivoire. \\n\\n2. \\nOn 15 January 2014, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of C\\x99te d\\xd5Ivoire: Argentina, Botswana and Kuwait.  \\n\\n3. \\nIn accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of C\\x99te d\\xd5Ivoire: \\n\\n\\n(a) \\nA national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/19/CIV/1); \\n\\n(b) \\nA compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/19/CIV/2); \\n\\n(c) \\nA summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/19/CIV/3). \\n\\n\\n4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, Liechtenstein, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to C\\x99te d\\xd5Ivoire through the troika. Those questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). \\nI. Summary of the proceedings of the review process \\nA. Presentation by the State under review \\n5. \\nThe head of the Ivorian delegation said that his country\\xd5s national report had been submitted in accordance with paragraph 5 of the annex to Human Rights Council resolution 16/21. The report had been prepared by a national universal periodic review team, the inherent difficulties faced by any administration emerging from a crisis notwithstanding. The results obtained had been extensively consolidated and shared with Ivorian civil society. \\n\\n6. \\nStructured around 13 main points, the C\\x99te d\\xd5Ivoire report could be summarized in three themes: the development of the normative and institutional framework; follow-up to and implementation of the recommendations and commitments arising from the universal periodic review; and the expectations of C\\x99te d\\xd5Ivoire in terms of capacity-building and technical assistance. \\n\\n7. \\nC\\x99te d\\xd5Ivoire had made efforts to bring its legal provisions into line with international standards. The Ivorian authorities had taken many steps to strengthen the national normative and institutional framework by adopting a number of laws and establishing operational structures. \\n\\n8. \\nC\\x99te d\\xd5Ivoire had adopted the law on the insertion of article 85 bis into title VI of the Constitution and on the International Criminal Court; the law on the establishment, remit, organization and operation of the National Human Rights Commission of C\\x99te d\\xd5Ivoire in accordance with the Paris Principles; the law on marriage, whose objective was to create de facto and de jure equality in Ivorian households; the law to amend the Nationality Code in relation to the procedure for acquiring nationality by marriage; particular provisions concerning the acquisition of nationality by declaration; the law on rural landownership; and the bill on sustainable development. \\n\\n9. \\nC\\x99te d\\xd5Ivoire had established several operational structures, including the Commission against Gender-Based Violence, the National Commission for the Family and the National Social Cohesion Programme. \\n\\n10. \\nIn March 2012, C\\x99te d\\xd5Ivoire had adopted the National Development Plan, a unifying framework for the implementation of all national development policies, structured around six areas: defence, security, justice and the rule of law; education, health, employment and social affairs; economy, agriculture and the private sector; infrastructure, water, energy and mines; environment, quality of life and habitat, public services; and culture, youth and sport. \\n\\n11. \\nThe national policy for the promotion and protection of human rights, introduced by the Ivorian Government in 2011, was monitored by the Ministry of Justice, Human Rights and Civil Liberties. A bill on the protection of human rights defenders had been drafted in cooperation with civil society and adopted by the Council of Ministers in September 2013. \\n\\n12. \\nC\\x99te d\\xd5Ivoire had made progress by acceding to the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons and the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness in October 2013; to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict in March 2012; and to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women in January 2012. \\n\\n13. \\nC\\x99te d\\xd5Ivoire had ratified the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples\\xd5 Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa in March 2012, and the amendment to the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal in September 2013. \\n\\n14. \\nDuring the previous universal periodic review, C\\x99te d\\xd5Ivoire had received 147 recommendations. It had accepted 108 of them, expressed reservations or observations in relation to 37 and rejected 2.
