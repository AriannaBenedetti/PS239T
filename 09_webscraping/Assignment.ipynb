    "`1`. In this week's lecture, we introduced a function `get_members()` which returns tuples of state senators (upper chamber) and house reps (lower chamber) from Illinois. **For this assignment, we will only be looking at the state senators and not the members of the state house.** We've provided a similar function below that returns a list of tuples: \n",
    "\n",
    "  - the senator's name\n",
    "  - their district number\n",
    "  - and their party\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goals in this problem set are:\n",
    "  - To scrape the relative URL (e.g. \"`/senate/SenatorBills.asp?MemberID=1911&GA=98`\" for each senator's list of bills\n",
    "  - To modify the relative URL to be a full URL _which only lists primary-sponsored bills_ (e.g. http://www.ilga.gov/senate/SenatorBills.asp?MemberID=1911&GA=98&Primary=True — note the \"`&Primary=True`\")\n",
    "  - To automatically scrape that list of bills primarily sponsored by each senator\n",
    "\n",
