# Introduction

### Motivation

Here's the dream:

> Computers have revolutionized research, and that revolution is only 
> beginning. Every day, scientists and engineers all over the world use
> them to study things that are too big, too small, too fast, too slow,
> too expensive, too dangerous, or just too hard to study any other way.

Now here's the reality:

> Every day, scholars all over the world waste time wrestling with 
> computers. Tasks that should take a few moments take hours or days, 
> and many things never work at all. When scientists try to get help, 
> they are inundated with unhelpful information, and give up.

This sorry state of affairs persists for three reasons:

1.   *No room, no time.*
    Everybody's schedule is full â€”- there's simply not space to add more
    about computing without dropping something else.

2.   *The blind leading the blind.*
    The infrastructure doesn't exist to help scholars develop the skills they need. Senior researchers can't teach the next generation how to do things
    that they don't know how to do themselves. 

3.   *Autodidact Chauvinism.*
    Since there are no classrooms, scholars are pressured to teach themselves. But self-learning is time consuming and nearly impossible without a base level of knowledge.

### Why Bother?

Why learn to program?

1.   *Practical Efficiency.*
    Even though it takes some time at first, learning how to program can save you an enormous amount of time doing basic tasks that you would otherwise do by hand, once you get the hang of it.

2.   *New Tools.*
    Some things are impossible, or nearly impossible to do by hand. Computers open the door for new tools and methods, but many require programming skills.

3.   *New Data.*
    The Internet is a wealth of data, waiting to be analyzed! Whether its collecting Twitter data, working with the Congress API, or scraping websites, programming knowledge is a must.

4.   *Better Science.*
    (Quality) programming can open the door to better transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration in the Social Sciences.

### Learning Objectives

> The basic learning objective of this course is to leave here with the 
> knowledge and skills required to learn on your own, whether that's through 
> programming documentation, StackExchange and other online fora, or D-Lab 
> workshops.

By the end of the course, students should be able to:

* Understand basic programming terminologies, structures, and conventions
* Navigate and operate effectively in a UNIX environment
* Master basic Git and GitHub workflows
* Write, execute, and debug R code for assignments involving statistical analysis
* Write, execute, and debug Python code for assignments involving data collection and manipulation, as well as other computing tasks
* Collect data through a variety of means, including webscraping and APIs.
* Be familiar with the concepts and tools of a variety of computational social science / digital humanities applications
* Be familiar with the basic guidelines around reproducible research, good scientific computing practices, and ethics/privacy/legal quandaries. 
* Learn independently and train themselves in a variety of computational applications and tasks through online documentation

### About Me and Disclaimers

My name is Rochelle Terman and I'm a Ph.D. Candidate in Political Science. 

* A few years ago, I didn't know how to program. Now I program almost every day. 
* I program mostly in Python and R. I have a special interest in text analysis and webscraping.
* I also do a lot of web development, especially in Drupal and Wordpress.
* My dissertation is on human rights. 
* I won't be able to answer all your questions.
* No one will.
* But especially me.
* Because programming is one endless Google Search.
