# Assignment 3

#### Due Sept 22

Complete the Codecademy Python Track!

1. Login into https://www.codecademy.com/. Your username is listed on bCourses. Your password is `pythonisawesome`

2. Navigate to the Python track and complete the course. 
You can skip Lesson 18: Introduction to Bitwise (unless you want to learn about Bitwise).

The estimated course time is 13 hours (it's probably shorter) so start early.  Each lesson should only take about 20-30 minutes. Doing a little bit every day is better than cramming everything in at the end.
