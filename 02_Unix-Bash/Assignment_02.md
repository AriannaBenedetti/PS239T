# Assignment 2

#### Due Sept 15

Part 1: Complete the Codecademy Command-Line Track.

Login into https://www.codecademy.com/. Your username is listed on bCourses. Your password is `rochelle`. 

If it important that you use this username/password combo, even if you already have a codecademy account, because otherwise I can't track your progress and you won't get credit for the assignment.

Navigate to the Command Line track and complete the course.

Part 2: Define one term in the glossery section of this week's [cheat-sheet](cheatsheet.md) by submitting a pull request on github. Don't do one somebody else has already defined.
