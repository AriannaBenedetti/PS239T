My final project batch downloads LexisNexis articles about protests in Brazil, splits them with Python (thanks Neal Caren!),
cross-references them using metadata (location of protest, date) with another dataset from another newspaper, and then 
calculates inter-rater reliability tests for the coding scheme I'm using.
